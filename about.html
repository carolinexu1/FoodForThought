  <p>Approximately <b>283,000 children under 20</b> in America have diabetes. This alarming statistic infringes upon not only the livelihoods of these children, but also the livelihoods of the parents. Those with diabetes depend on regulating their glucose levels to survive. </p>
  
  <p> With diabetic limitations on the quantity of glucose one can take, making healthy and safe meals are vital. This is where Food For Thought comes in. Food For Thought allows the user to find their nearby hospital or primary care provider and locate the grocery stores and food banks closest to them.</p>

  <p> Additionally, nutritional labels given by the FDA are cluttered with unnecessary information. Food For Thought declutters this and organizes the information into a clear and concise manner for anyone to use to plan their meals.
